The aim of this analysis is to investigate a range of health-related factors and their interconnections to classify diabetes accurately. These factors include aspects such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.Built using Streamlit for instant web access — no installation required.
